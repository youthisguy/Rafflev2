If your contract must store the response (or\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n *\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n *\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\n */\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\n  // solhint-disable-next-line chainlink-solidity/prefix-immutable-variables-with-i\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\n\n  /**\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\n   */\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.

@notice Interface for contracts using VRF randomness\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev PURPOSE\n @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness\n @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not\n @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key\n @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\n @dev from the output space.\n @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\n @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\n @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\n @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\n @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev USAGE\n @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\n @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\n @dev shown:\n @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\n @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\n @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\n @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\n @dev       }\n @dev   }\n @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\n @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it\n @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\n @dev subscription management functions).\n @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\n @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\n @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\n @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\n @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\n @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\n @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\n @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\n @dev with which randomness request.\n @dev See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\n @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\n @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n @dev differ.\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\n @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\n @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\n @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\n @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\n @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\n @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\n @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\n @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software)."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":325,"linearizedBaseContracts":[325],"name":"VRFConsumerBaseV2","nameLocation":"5351:17:6","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"errorSelector":"1cf993f4","id":276,"name":"OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill","nameLocation":"5379:25:6","nodeType":"ErrorDefinition","parameters":{"id":275,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":272,"mutability":"mutable","name":"have","nameLocation":"5413:4:6","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":276,"src":"5405:12:6","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":271,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5405:7:6","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":274,"mutability":"mutable","name":"want","nameLocation":"5427:4:6","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":276,"src":"5419:12:6","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":273,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5419:7:6","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"5404:28:6"},"src":"5373:60:6"},{"constant":false,"id":278,"mutability":"immutable","name":"vrfCoordinator","nameLocation":"5546:14:6","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":325,"src":"5520:40:6","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":277,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5520:7:6","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"private"},{"body":{"id":288,"nodeType":"Block","src":"5677:43:6","statements":[{"expression":{"id":286,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftHandSide":{"id":284,"name":"vrfCoordinator","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":278,"src":"5683:14:6","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"nodeType":"Assignment","operator":"=","rightHandSide":{"id":285,"name":"_vrfCoordinator","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":281,"src":"5700:15:6","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"src":"5683:32:6","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"id":287,"nodeType":"ExpressionStatement","src":"5683:32:6"}]},"documentation":{"id":279,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5565:72:6","text":" @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract"},"id":289,"implemented":true,"kind":"constructor","modifiers":[],"name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":282,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":281,"mutability":"mutable","name":"_vrfCoordinator","nameLocation":"5660:15:6","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":289,"src":"5652:23:6","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":280,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"5652:7:6","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"5651:25:6"},"returnParameters":{"id":283,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[],"src":"5677:0:6"},"scope":325,"src":"5640:80:6","stateMutability":"nonpayable","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"documentation":{"id":290,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"5724:686:6","text":" @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.

If your contract must store the response (or\\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\\n *\\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\\n */\\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\\n  // solhint-disable-next-line chainlink-solidity/prefix-immutable-variables-with-i\\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\\n   */\\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.

If your contract must store the response (or\\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\\n *\\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\\n * @dev to the VRF.
